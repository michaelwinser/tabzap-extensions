Alt-Tab style tab switching with Most Recently Used ordering. Navigate tabs like you navigate windows.

### Detailed Description (max 16,000 characters)
<!-- Full description shown on the extension's store page -->
TabZap Switch brings Alt-Tab style navigation to your browser tabs. Switch between tabs based on when you last used them, not their position in the tab bar.

**Features:**
• Most Recently Used (MRU) tab ordering
• Keyboard shortcuts for quick switching
• Visual overlay showing tab history
• Works across all your tabs
• Configurable hotkeys

**How it works:**
Press the configured hotkey to switch to your previously active tab. Hold the modifier and press again to go further back in your tab history. Release to stay on the selected tab.

**Default Shortcuts:**
• Media Previous Track - Go back in tab history
• Media Next Track - Go forward in tab history

You can customize these in Chrome's extension shortcuts: chrome://extensions/shortcuts

**Privacy:**
This extension only tracks which tabs you switch between to maintain the MRU order. No data is collected or transmitted.
